          My journey as a full-stack developer at Addis Ababa University has
          been driven by a deep passion for blending technology and business. I
          am fascinated by how digital solutions create opportunities, and I
          constantly explore ways to bridge the gap between innovation and
          entrepreneurship. At 23, I dedicate my time to mastering both fields,
          studying relentlessly to understand their intersection. This is why I
          created DaguLearnâ€”an initiative to provide monetization access for
          Ethiopian creators, as YouTube has not yet introduced monetization in
          Ethiopia. Technology isn't just a tool for me; it's a means to create
          impactful change and empower others.
